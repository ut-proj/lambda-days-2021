## 18 March - Glasgow CodeCraft

**Making Music with Software** - Duncan McGreggor

No recording or custom slides; recused slide material from other talks. However, we did a mini-workshop, based upon  Andrew Sorensen's [2015 Codemania Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpSYWd_aIiI) ("A Programmer's Guide To Western Music"). The Code used for this (some of it adapted to MIDI) is available here:
