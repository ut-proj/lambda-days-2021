# Sound on BEAM: Music in the Land of Distributed Lisp

[//]: Speaker-Notes:

Welcome to the talk!

My name is Duncan McGreggor, and today I'm going to share with you a little
of Lisp Flavoured Erlang, some Extempore, talk about music synthesis and
recording, and how they all come together in the undertone project.

* ❤️Functional Programming (career)
* ❤️Music (...)
* (& ❤️Lisp)

The last musical performance I gave was as the pianist in a chamber music quartest when I was 17. 

In my 20s, I built a hobbyist home recording studio. This was the early-to-mid-90s, so everything was analog.

## Why this topic?

Then, when I was 42, I met Andrew Sorensen after his Extempore live-coding performance at OSCON 2014,
created a variation on his piece, and thus began a slow-reignition of my passion for music.

Now playing my two main instruments again, even taking courses.ss

## What is undertone?

<img src="teaser_video_daw.jpg" />

{{% note %}}
In my 2021 Lambda Days "teaser" video some of you may have seen, there are 9 seperate tracks of synthesizer being played. All of those were generated by undertone.

## What is undertone?

<ul>
<li>That music you heard? That.</li>
<li class="fragment">Sort of.</li>
<li class="fragment">Lots of software synthesizers, played via MIDI.</li>
<li class="fragment">Routed by Extempore.</li>
<li class="fragment">Over TCP.</li>
<li class="fragment">It's complicated.</li>
</ul>

## Architecture

[//]: Speaker-Notes:

Here's a diagram of the system context for undertone.
{{% /note %}}

---

## Architecture

System context for undertone:

* uses Erlang (starts up supervision tree, clients, servers)
* talks to Extempore (bitstrings over TCP)
* controls OSC servers (e.g., DAWs)

## Architecture

System context for Extempore:

* talks to the OS / routes MIDI
* signals routed to external devices
* also routed to MIDI in the DAW (e.g., software synthesizers)

We can see a little more of what's going on under the bonnet.
{{% /note %}}

---

## Architecture

The undertone "container":

* OTP app with supervisor and state server
* State server for mananging session commands and system config
* OSC clients for any OSC-enabled software running a UDP server
* TCP client for long-running connections to Extempore
* LFE REPL
* Extempore REPL

## Ways to Use undertone

<ul>
<li>Controlling.</li>
<li class="fragment">Playing.</li>
<li class="fragment">And controlling.</li>
<li class="fragment">And more playing.</li>
</ul>


[//]: Speaker-Notes:
{{% note %}}
Because once you can control your music devices programmatically, you can play them in new and different ways.

---

## Personal interests in its use

* Long, slow looping music in given keys, but random notes or intervals
* Accompanyment for practice
  * Jam sessions
* Endless, non-repeating background, ambient music

Since this is for fun, and the love of the art, I want to do it in a manner I will enjoy.

## FP in an I/O World

<img src="lol_clean_fp.jpg" />

[//]: Speaker-Notes:

So why would someone go through all the effort to put a functional wrapper around so much I/O and global, mutable state?

## FP in an I/O World

[//]: Speaker-Notes:

Functional Programming meets musical composition:

* better (more disciplined) control over the control global environment
